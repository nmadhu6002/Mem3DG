    "We can also do this on an generated icosphere. However, because of the symmetry of a icosphere, it appears that we need large osmotic pressure to kick start the deformation. To change the set up of $\\texttt{System}$, it is generally safer practice to reinstantiate a new $\\texttt{System}$ object. However, because of the simplicity of current setup, the rest of the system does not have complex dependency on attribute changes. Therefore we directly modify the underlying attribute $K_v$ and increase it by fivefold."
